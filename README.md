# Criptography

Is a method of developing techniques and protocols to prevent a third party form accessing and gaining knowledge of the data from the private messages during a communication process.

From Greek:

Kryptos ==>> Hidden

Graphein ==>> To write

 - Encryption: A process that converts PLAIN text into CIPHERTEXT
 - Encryption <<==>> Decription
 - Cipher: The mathematical function that is used to convert plaintext to ciphertext
 - Key: A small amount of information that is required to induce the output of the cryptographic algorithm
 - Ceaser Cipher (switch letter by 1)

The caesae cipher is one example of a larger class of techniques called Substitution Ciphers.
